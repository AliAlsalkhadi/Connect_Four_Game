# Connect Four
Connect Four is a classic two-player game where players take turns dropping shaps into a vertical grid. The goal of the game is to connect four of your own shaps in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This implementation of Connect Four is written in C and can be played on the command line.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile the source code using a C compiler, such as GCC.
3. Run the executable file.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.

## Game Rules
1. Players take turns dropping their colored disks into the grid.
2. The bottom-most empty space in the chosen column will be filled with the player's disk.
3. The game ends when one player connects four of their disks in a row or when the grid is full.
